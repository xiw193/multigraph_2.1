                                  Installation

The directory src contains the following files:

 1. mg0.f                           module that sets precision
 2. solver.f                        the solver routines
 3. driver.f                        graphics and driver routines
 4. webgui.c                        web browser interface
 5. atest.f                         main driver program
 6. Makefile                        a simple generic makefile
 7. Makefile_osx                    an example makefile for OS X  

You can set the precision in the module mthdef in the file mg0.f. This
module is machine dependent, but should work as provided in most
environments. Set the integer arithmetic to single or
double precision as desired; the default is single precision.
Floating point can be single, double, or quadruple precision;
the default is double precision.

If you want to incorporate the solver into your own environment,
just compile and link the files mg0.f and solver.f with your existing 
application, and call the appropriate subroutines as described in the 
documentation.

If you want to use the included test driver, your environment
must include both Fortran90 and C compilers. To make an executable, 
you must compile mg0.f, solver.f, driver.f, webgui.c and atest.f.
A generic Makefile is provided (along with a sample Makefile for OS X). 
To use the Makefile, specify paths for the compilers  and set
compiler flags as necessary.
